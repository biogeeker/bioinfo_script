# Bioinformatics scripts

A collection of light bioinformatics analysis pipelines for specific tasks.

### Python
- Print feature sequences given GFF file and FASTA file (e.g. extracting CDS sequences) - gff_loader.py
- Converting GenBank/EMBL to GFF (for QUAST) - gb_embl2gff.py
- Converting JCVI .simple file to Circos .links file - simple2links.py
- Filtering subsequences according to seq length - fasta_len_filter.py
- Sequencing data alignment results statistics - alignment_stats.py
- Synonymous calculation
- Codon table calculation
- Extract introns sequence and GFF file
- Given gene ids, extract subsets from GFF file
- Shell scripts for one line data processing

### R

### Shell
- Extracting subset from GFF file according to ids - extract_sub_gff.sh
- 

Dive into specific folder to view more detailed usage on each script's function.
