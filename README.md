# Bioinformatics scripts

A collection of light bioinformatics analysis pipelines for specific tasks.

### / --- *Python* --- /
- Print feature sequences given GFF file and FASTA file (e.g. extracting CDS sequences) - gff_loader.py
- Converting GenBank/EMBL to GFF (for QUAST) - gb_embl2gff.py
- Converting JCVI .simple file to Circos .links file - simple2links.py
- Filtering subsequences according to seq length - fasta_len_filter.py
- Sequencing data alignment results statistics - alignment_stats.py
- SNP annotation - snp_annotate.py
- 4DTV atx to one-line - atx2oneline.py
- Synonymous calculation
- Codon table calculation
- Extract introns sequence and GFF file
- Given gene ids, extract subsets from GFF file
- Shell scripts for one line data processing

### */ --- Perl --- /*
- Calculate 4DTV - caculate_4DTV_correction.pl
- 
-

### Shell
- Extracting subset from GFF file according to ids - extract_sub_gff.sh
-
