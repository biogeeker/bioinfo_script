# Bioinformatics scripts

A collection of light bioinformatics analysis pipelines for specific tasks.

### Python
- Print feature sequences given GFF file and FASTA file (e.g. extracting CDS sequences) - gff_loader.py
- Covert GenBank/EMBL to GFF (for QUAST) - gb_embl2gff.py
- JCVI .simple file to Circos .links file
- Synonymous calculation
- Codon table calculation
- Extract introns sequence and GFF file
- Given gene ids, extract subsets from GFF file
- Shell scripts for one line data processing

### R

### Shell
